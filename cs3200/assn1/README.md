### Run Instructions
*   Make the assn1 folder the working directory
*   Use the command ```python assn1.py``` to run program
*   This will print out the estimated temperature based on the different step sizes from the ```forward_euler_algorithm``` and ```euler_trapezoidal_algorithm``` functions depending on which is selected by the ```plot_results``` function.
*   In order to produce the graphs the ```plot_results``` function needs to be uncommented and will produce the graph with all of the different step sizes ploted depending on if the first parameter is set to **"Euler Trapezoidal"** or **"Forward Euler"**
